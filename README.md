## 💡 Development Philosophy
Every project I build started as a personal frustration.
I see a problem → I pick the right tool → I build the solution.

## 📚 Continuous Learning
- Building projects across multiple languages and paradigms
- Taking courses on Udemy and YouTube
- Experimenting with new libraries and frameworks
- Applying classroom learning to real-world projects
- Contributing to team projects and collaborative development

## 🎯 Featured Project

### 🎮 Cloverville Project *(Semester 1)*
A comprehensive Java-based management solution designed to help 
sustainable village communities track villager activities, 
contributions, and community resources. Built to promote 
transparency and engagement in eco-friendly settlements.

## 🎯 Project Overview
Cloverville enables community administrators to:
- Register and manage villager profiles
- Track individual contributions to community projects
- Monitor daily activities and participation
- Generate reports on community engagement
- Manage resource allocation across the village

## 👷 My Role: Backend Developer & System Architect

Out of a team of 3, I owned the technical foundation of the project 
designing the system architecture and implementing the backend logic 
that powered the entire application.

### 🏗️ System Architecture & Design

**Class Diagram Design**
- Identified all core entities: Villager, Activity, Contribution, 
  Administrator, Report
- Defined relationships, inheritance hierarchies, and associations
  between objects
- Established clear separation of concerns across system layers
- Ensured the class structure supported future scalability
